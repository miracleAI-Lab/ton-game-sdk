# üéÆ Game Development UI Component Library

A customizable UI component library built on the **Phaser** game engine.

- **Phaser Version**: [3.8+](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
- **Repository**: [mai3-phaser-ui](https://github.com/miracleAI-Lab/mai3-phaser-ui)
- **Development Server**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/miracleAI-Lab/mai3-phaser-ui-examples
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd mai3-phaser-ui-examples
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have **yarn** installed. If not, you can install it globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

Now, install the project dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using Vite:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the server and provide you with a local development URL, usually `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Open the Project in Your Browser

Once the development server is running, open your browser and navigate to the local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). You should now see the UI components and the game environment rendered in your browser.

### 5. Modify and Customize

Now you can begin customizing the UI components or adding your own components by modifying the source files in the project.
